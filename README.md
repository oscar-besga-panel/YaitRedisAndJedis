##### RedisDesktopManager  
https://redisdesktop.com  
Is open source, but the company only provides the code, so:   
You can compile the code into your system (instruction in github https://github.com/uglide/RedisDesktopManager)  
Use snap and snapcraft in Linux to install last version  
Use the last compiled version for Windows (https://github.com/uglide/RedisDesktopManager/releases/tag/0.9.3)  
Don't know where to get it for Macos
